This file holds some basic documentation about the NKT matlab driver.

These scripts require a go-hcit server to be running that deals with
the low-level communication with the NKT lasers.

The scripts here do not deal with errors, this is deferred to a later user
upgrade.

See the OpenAPI3 docs for details on the HTTP communication.

This driver may serve as a basic reference for how to write drivers using
the HTTP adapter servers for other hardware.  Users should be able to use
this and the OpenAPI3 docs to write drivers for other hardware.
